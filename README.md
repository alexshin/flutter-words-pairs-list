# Overview

The application is only for test purposes to train writing cross-platform mobile apps using a new

My personal opinion that Dart seems as a language between JS and TypeScript. For sure it's more
powerful and less problematic than pure JS without type hinting, named arguments etc. But personally
for me TypeScript seems really more useful one.
